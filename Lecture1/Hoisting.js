// Temporal Dead Zone.
// Its the time between the let/const is hoisted & until its initialized
// variable hoisted =======> variable initialized
// If you try to use the let/const in between this above mentioned journey/step, then you will get ref error

// In the above example, we have 
// a is var type, b is let type and c is const type
// If we DEBUG deeply, we find that
// a is put in global scope
// b and c are put in 'script' scope
// We cannot access script memmory space
